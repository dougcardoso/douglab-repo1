If you want to check for any of those specific Oracle errors (`ORA`, `SP2`, `PLS`) in the output of a command and fail the task if any are found, you can extend the `failed_when` condition. Here's an example of how you can structure your task:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Execute Oracle command
    command: /path/to/your/oracle/command
    register: oracle_output
    failed_when: 
      - "'ORA-' in oracle_output.stdout or 'ORA-' in oracle_output.stderr"
      - "'SP2-' in oracle_output.stdout or 'SP2-' in oracle_output.stderr"
      - "'PLS-' in oracle_output.stdout or 'PLS-' in oracle_output.stderr"
```

This task:

- Executes your Oracle-related command with the `command` module.
- Registers the output of the command in the `oracle_output` variable.
- Checks the `stdout` and `stderr` of the command for any of the specified Oracle error codes. If any are found, the task fails, and by default, the playbook halts.

Remember to adjust `/path/to/your/oracle/command` to the actual path of your Oracle command or script.
